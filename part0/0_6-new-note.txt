browser->server: HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa

note:
the code searches for the ElementById('notes_form')
*when the submit button of the form has been clicked*
the event handler calls the method e.preventDefault() preventing to do the ancient way of creating new notes (GET request)
the event handler now creates the new note and appends it at the end of the notes list
rerenders the notes list and send the newest note to the server
the new note is modified before send it in the POST as a JSON data type with the attribute 'Content-type' -> 'application/json' in the header
when the modification is done, the new note is sent as a JSON string using the method JSON.stringify()
